#	PROLOG SYNTAX	#
#####################

# We can divide elements of prolog in this categories:
# -	Atoms
# - Numbers
# - Variables
# - Complex Terms

#############
#	ATOM	#
#############

# There are 3 types of atoms:
# 1.	Is a string that begins with a lowercase letter and composed by 
#		uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, underscore character.
# 2.	Is a sequence of charcters enclosed in single quotes. It can contains also special chars and spaces.
# 3.	Is a string of special chars, and some of them has a pre-defined meaning, for example strings like :-

#####################
#	   NUMBERS		#
#####################

# Prolog supports integers and floating point numbers, but this one are less important in prolog.
# Intergers are more important because they're used to manipulating lists.

#################
#	VARIABLES	#
#################

# Is a string that begins with an undescore or with an uppercase letter and is composed by:
# - lowercase letters
# - uppercase letters
# - underscores characters
#
# There's a special variable that is _ (underscore). It's called anoymous variable.

#####################
#	COMPLEX TERMS	#
#####################

# Atoms, number and variables are needed to create complex terms. Complex terms are functions that are composed by
# a functor (function name) and one or more arguments enclosed by simple parentheses separated by comas.
#
# Arguments can be atoms, number, variables and also complex terms.
#
# The number of argumens that a complex terms need is called arity. This is important because prolog give the possibility to 
# create more complex terms with the same functor but different arity. This property is called overload.
